"I have over 20 years experience in mental health counseling and hospice. I love working with the senior population especially our veterans. Their stories are so incredible, especially their \"love stories\". It makes what I do more of a privilege than a job...\
 I developed a true passion for working with clients and their families after helping care for my dad and then caring for my mother. Caregiving is bitter sweet. It is a labor of love, but can be both emotionally and physically exhausting. I try to make sure my caregivers get the support and education they need while providing services for our clients.\
 I truly love what I am doing and it makes getting up and going to work each day so so much more rewarding than just having a job. I am so blessed and thankful to my Heavenly Father for providing me with great people, resources, a wonderful support system and new opportunities. I am especially thankful for my role on the Alabama Elder Care Planning Council and all the great people I get to work with to help educate seniors and those who care for them.","united kingdom; united states",""
